title: Kerala
summary: Kerala is a distributed event-streaming server built on top of the Raft protocol. It is robust, lightweight and super fast! I mostly started this project as I was curious of distributed consensus algorithms and generally data-intensive applications. Kerala was my outlet for 2 years &amp; I learned so much in the process.
