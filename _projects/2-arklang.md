title: Arklang
summary: Curious about programming languages, I dived into <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">craftinginterpreters.com</a> and learned how to implement an object-oriented language. Inspired by this, I took my learnings and made my own language with it's own syntax and some cool quirks.
