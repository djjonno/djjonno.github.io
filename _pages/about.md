Hey, I'm Jonathon. I'm from Australia, currently living in Seattle WA, writing software for Amazon.com.

I am just so passionate about code and the craft of writing code. I have been coding for almost 10 years now and have culminated many hours banging my head against the wall while trying to refine my craft. I expect many more hours ahead.

One of the many things that make me passionate about code is that there are endless possibilities for what you can accomplish simply by giving a computer explicit instructions. You can make a website, a text editor, and even send people into space. Software really is a life-blood of this crazy world we're a piece of.

My passion is forever kindled by the admiration of doing a seemingly simple project but there comes a very specific moment when you're deep in the weeds that you find these absolute gems, these forks in the road, these paths untaken that are ripe for exploring, adventuring and learning. With your head deep in a problem, it's simply wonderful how much joy you can find by solving that problem and trekking that unbeaten path that only you are walking. Just awesome.

Apart from coding, I also love snowboarding & writing (not code).

This is my home on the web. Feel free to follow my journey on <a href="https://medium.com/@jonathonscanes">Medium</a> (I post semi-regularly), and <a href="https://github.com/djjonno">Github</a> where I'm always working on something. I typically write about **coding**, **data-intensive applications** & **side projects**.
